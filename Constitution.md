# Definitions

## **Open Club**
These clubs make up a large majority of groups on campus because their memberships are open to any undergraduate or graduate student of the University of Manitoba, so long as no less than two-thirds of the club is undergraduate students.

## **Executive**
This is a label for individuals that take up positions at the top of the club’s management hierarchy. These individuals are the final decision-makers for the club’s business such as Operations, Finance, Events, and Marketing. Regardless of their label internally or externally, if the position is labelled as an executive to UMSU, we will view the individual as an integral position to the club who holds responsibility and oversight.

## **Signing Authority**
This is a label for specific individuals who have authorization to sign cheques, contracts, or anything legally binding in relation the club. Usually this is in reference to individuals who have authority to manage and access bank accounts, but it can also be used in UMSU for individuals who can make contracts with UMSU.

## **Conflict of Interest**
This conflict happens when an entity or individual becomes unreliable because of a clash between personal interests and professional duties or responsibilities. Such a conflict occurs when an organisation or person has a specific interest in the outcome and serves to gain from it —such as money, status, knowledge, relationships, or reputation—which puts into question whether their actions, judgement, and/or decision-making can be neutral. (Investopedia)

## **Community**

## Article 2c: Executive Officer Dismissal Protocol
Executive Officer(s) that fail to uphold their basic duties outlined in [**Article 2b**](#article-2b-executive-officers-and-duties) and/or violate any Governance articles in [**Section 4: Club Governance**](#section-4-club-governance) are subjected to temporary probation for a performance review. This performance review must be started and conducted by the President and requires a clear written assessment of the officer’s performance versus the minimum threshold of the duties that the officer must do as outlined in [**Article 2b**](#article-2b-executive-officers-and-duties) and/or [**Section 4: Club Governance**](#section-4-club-governance). Written assessment must be documented, dated, and stored in case the club is under investigation.

Criteria and reasoning for dismissal must not be discriminatory by nature and cannot be influenced by a person’s race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, record of offences, marital status, family status or disability. Exceptions can only apply if they are legitimate factors that negatively affect performance. In that case, written minutes with a cover letter explanation must be documented when performing this exception. There must always be a clear record and reason for a dismissal.

If there are no written minutes, written notice, and/or the information presented in the documents are unfaithful before the dismissal, this is considered an unfair dismissal. A club that is under investigation and found to have performed an unfair dismissal(s) will be subjected to the disciplinary items in [**Article 4e: Violations to Constitution**](#article-4e-violations-to-constitution).

If an executive officer is dismissed, the club must follow [**Section 3: Club Changeover**](#section-3-club-changeover) in order to follow the proper procedure(s) outlined to fill the vacant position(s).

## Article 2d: Councillors

Councillor duties are outlined by committee in [**Article 2e: Committees and Duties**](#article-2e-committees-and-duties)

# Section 3: Club Changeover

## Article 3a: Conflict of Interest
A Conflict of Interest is defined as when an entity or individual becomes unreliable because of a clash between personal interests and professional duties or responsibilities. Such a conflict occurs when an organisation or person has a specific interest in the outcome and serves to gain from it —such as money, status, knowledge, relationships, or reputation—which puts into question whether their actions, judgement, and/or decision-making can be neutral.

During an election process, conflicts of interest may arise. When they do, the individual who has professional duties or responsibilities related to organising the democratic election procedure must identify their conflict of interest and withdraw from the role for that particular election. This is to guarantee a fair democratic process. Failure to identify the conflict of interest and/or withdrawal from the role will be considered a violation to the club’s constitution and the club will be subjected to the disciplinary items outlined in [**Article 4e: Violations to Constitution**](#article-4e-violations-to-constitution).

Results from a Democratic Election that had a conflict of interest may be subject to be voided. A rerun of the democratic election without any conflicts of interest may begin again for the open executive position(s).

## Article 3b: Chief Returning Officer Appointment
Prior to the election, the Executives agree to appoint a Chief Returning Officer (CRO) to oversee the election. This CRO ensures the election is run competently, fairly, and transparently to its members and UMSU.

To ensure the election is run fairly and transparently, the CRO must:

- Not be a person who is running in the election.
- Not have any conflicts of interest with the club’s management or electoral candidates. This conflict of interest is outlined in [**Article 3a: Conflict of Interest**](#article-3a-conflict-of-interest).
- Be neutral and unbiased about the club and their electoral candidates in their election through their professional duties.

If a member or members of the executive team appoint CROs with a conflict of interest and continue to run elections with that conflict of interest, this is considered a violation to the constitution and the club is subjected to [**Article 4e: Violations to Constitution**](#article-4e-violations-to-constitution).

## Article 3c: Chief Returning Officer Duties
The duties of the CRO are to:

1. Oversee and administer the elections for CSSA.
2. Publicise the elections to the membership of CSSA.
3. Hear and decide on any appeals or complaints related to the elections.
4. Oversee and administer the electronic system’s results for votes of the election.
5. Announce the results of the elections and inform UMSU of who next year’s Executive will be.

## Article 3d: President Appointment Procedure
All CSSA Presidential elections for the upcoming year will occur no later than March 31st on an annual basis.

Prior to the election, the Executives shall appoint a Chief Returning Officer (CRO) to oversee the elections via the procedure outlined in [**Article 3b: Chief Returning Officer Appointment**](#article-3b-chief-returning-officer-appointment).

Voting for the upcoming year’s President will be conducted as follows:

1. The electoral President position must be posted adequately and competently advertised to the club’s membership at least 2 weeks in advance. This post must be shown through at least the club’s membership email list and social media.
2. Nominations for the elected position will last for a minimum of three days. Candidates who wish to be nominated should inform the CRO during that period, and must be a member in good standing of CSSA at the time of their nomination.
3. Each nominated candidate is allowed to campaign on behalf of themselves and any slate (or team) they are a part of during the campaigning period, which will last for at least a week.
4. The CRO will collect a brief biography and campaign platform from each candidate and distribute them all to the club’s current membership email list of CSSA prior to voting. This list must be of members from the current academic year and any tampering of this list will void the election results as well as constitute a constitution violation.
5. Voting will be open for at least two days, and will be held through a secure online voting platform. It has to be accessible to all members of the club.
6. The results from the online voting platform will be collected by the CRO. These results will be sent to candidates and CSSA members.

Any tampering of the democratic voting process outlined here will constitute as a violation to the constitution and the club is subjected to [**Article 4e: Violations to Constitution**](#article-4e-violations-to-constitution).

## Article 3e: Council Appointment Systems
If there are open council position(s) available, positions can be appointed through either a democratic election procedure or an application selection procedure. It is up to the President to decide which procedure will best fit for the club and their community based on the status of the club at the time of council formation. This is subject to [**Article 2d: Councillors**](#article-2d-councillors). Note that the criteria and reasoning for any aspects of the council appointment – such as application, interviews, selection, etc. – must not be discriminatory by nature and should not factor a person’s race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, record of offences, marital status, family status or disability. Exceptions can only apply if they are legitimate factors that negatively affect performance. In that case, a cover letter explanation must be documented per exception.

If it is found that a council appointment was not appointed in good faith and the procedure was not followed, the action will be considered in violation of the constitution and the club will be subjected to [**Article 4e: Violations to Constitution**](#article-4e-violations-to-constitution).

### Democratic Election Procedure

Any tampering of the democratic voting process outlined here will constitute as a violation to the constitution and the club is subjected to [**Article 4e: Violations to Constitution**](#article-4e-violations-to-constitution).

### Application Selection Procedure
All CSSA Council Positions must be filled for the upcoming year by no later than October 1st on an annual basis. Exceptions can only be made on a case-by-case basis such as an executive being dismissed.

Before advertising the vacant council position(s), the new President must appoint a Selections Committee to assist in selecting the upcoming year’s Council:
- The appointment of the Selections Committee individuals must be chosen through a democratic vote from the previous year’s council.
- If the Selections Committee does not consist of the new President and last year’s 10 Council Members, then this procedure cannot be enacted. In total, you will have 11 members on this committee. This is considered the general standard for the Selections Committee structure.
- In the case that the Selections Committee cannot be appointed due to not fulfilling the requirements, the President must use the Democratic Election Procedure outlined above.

Appointment for the upcoming year’s Council will be conducted as follows:

1. The vacant council position(s) must be posted adequately and competently advertised to the club’s membership at least 2 weeks in advance. This post must be shown through at least the club’s membership email list and social media.
2. When gathering all of the applications, they all must be given a chance for an interview. Applications can be voided if the application’s information is objectively not considered complete.
3. When interviewing the candidates for the vacant positions, these must be held and approached in a fair manner.
4. Documentation for each candidate’s interview must take place for review and auditing purposes.
5. When interviews are over, the Selections Committee must review the documentation for each candidate’s interview for the selected vacant position.
6. Selection of candidates for the position must be agreed upon via a majority vote from the Selections Committee.
7. The offer must be presented to the first candidate of choice.
8. If the offer is not accepted, then the offer must be presented to the runner-up and it will continue until the list is exhausted.
9. If the position remains vacant, the President can choose to redo the appointment procedure in this article or remove that position entirely.
10. Once the selection process is over and the positions are filled, the new President is responsible for announcing to each candidate individually if they have gotten the position or not.

Any tampering of the process outlined here will constitute as a violation to the constitution and the club is subjected to [**Article 4e: Violations to Constitution**](#article-4e-violations-to-constitution).

## Article 3f: Executive Transition Procedure

1. The moment an incoming executive(s) has been officially named to be appointed into their new role, the transition procedure starts immediately. Ideally, this should be around the mid-end of the Winter Term or beginning of the Summer Term.
2. The departing executive(s) must prepare and transition the incoming executive(s) into their respective roles. This includes teaching the incoming executives about the student club, UMSU policies and procedures, and completing UMSU Administrative paperwork such as the annual club renewal.
3. The departing executives must transition all club records, offline and online accounts, bank accounts, and materials to the incoming executives in order for them to be effective in their roles.
4. The incoming executives are responsible for the custody of all student club records, materials, and accountability for all future financial activities of the club.
5. The departing President and Finance executive must bring all accounts up to date by the end of the fiscal year. They must also prepare any required financial statements of the club. The old executive signing authorities' must hand over control of the club’s bank account and any related items to the new executive signing authorities.

It is imperative that signing authorities' hand over the club’s bank account on a yearly basis. If the executive team fails to take the appropriate and formal steps to transfer this authority, credit scores may be negatively affected by the bank; or the club's bank account may receive other disciplinary action from the financial institution for not taking the proper steps when transitioning their bank accounts.

The reason this is important is because personal information gets attached to bank accounts. If your name remains attached to a club's bank account after you have finished your term, you may be liable for future actions you have no part in simply because your name was left as an active member of the account.

If you are unsure about your working relationship and status with the bank, please talk to your bank's appropriate representative and they should be able to provide any and all information about your club's bank account.

## Article 3e: Councillor Appointment Procedure

# Section 4: Club Governance

## Article 4a: Compliance with University of Manitoba Students' Union (UMSU) Policies
CSSA will comply with the University of Manitoba Students’ Union (UMSU) and follow all of its bylaws, policies, procedures, and any mandatory training workshop required. Also, CSSA will follow the policies and procedures found in the UMSU Student Clubs Policies and Procedures document.

These bylaws, policies, procedures, and workshops are designed with fostering a healthy safe environment in the clubs and protecting students. When a club does not follow the bylaws, policies, procedures, or workshops, then a club may be investigated. When being investigated, the club will comply with cooperating and providing the necessary documents as well as information. Any club that acts unfaithfully in the investigation process will be subjected to [**Article 4e: Violations to Constitution**](#article-4e-violations-to-constitution).

If any article in the club’s constitution is in direct conflict with [**Article 4a: Compliance with UMSU Policies**](#article-4a-compliance-with-university-of-manitoba-students-union-umsu-policies), then [**Article 4a**](#article-4a-compliance-with-university-of-manitoba-students-union-umsu-policies) will take first priority and dismiss the effect of the other conflicting article. This is to ensure that clubs are compliant with UMSU policies which are designed to protect students.

## Article 4b: Compliance to a Sexual Violence Prevention Workshop
To prevent sexual violence, CSSA council agrees to attend a sexual violence prevention workshop at UMSU’s discretion and direction. CSSA council agree to be held accountable for their community’s conduct with respect to sexual violence.

At this workshop, usually hosted by Justice for Women’s University of Manitoba Club, CSSA council agrees to learn, apply, and adapt the content in the workshop towards their own club’s community. If the Justice for Women’s University of Manitoba Club is absent, UMSU will have full discretion in determining who will host these workshops.

The completion of the workshop is required before CSSA can be recognized as a club by UMSU. This requirement must be completed before the end of the Fall semester in the academic year. Exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis based on Student Group Services' discretion such as timing of club renewal.

## Article 4c: Compliance with University of Manitoba's Community Code of Conduct
To foster an inclusive and welcoming community, CSSA will follow the code of conduct and behaviours expected of the University of Manitoba community outlined by the University of Manitoba Administration.

Also, CSSA agrees to foster an environment that does not encourage STUDENT NON-ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT AND CONCERNING BEHAVIOUR outlined by the University of Manitoba.

## Article 4d: Amendments to Constitution
Any changes (amendments) to this constitution must first be presented and reviewed by UMSU Student Group Services to ensure they align with UMSU policy. Once approved by Student Group Services, the constitution must then be approved by a formal vote of the entire student club membership at a publicised meeting. This meeting can be hosted in-person or virtual.

The student club membership list is generally held by the executive council and the council is responsible for communicating these constitution changes to the members. Failure to communicate these changes and failure to host a publicised meeting qualifies as a violation to the constitution.

The proposed changes must be made available to all members of the club at least two weeks before the meeting. To vote in favour of the amendment, this vote requires the support of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the members present and voting at the meeting.

After the members of the club approve the constitution, a copy of the amended constitution must be submitted to UMSU to be considered officially updated.

To prevent corruption, [**Section 4: Club Governance**](#section-4-club-governance) and its associated articles cannot be changed (amended). These articles can only be changed if the change is mandated by UMSU explicitly in writing or the change was first proposed to UMSU by the club’s council and the club has received explicit approval of the change by UMSU Student Group Services in writing.

## Article 4e: Violations to Constitution
When an executive or multiple executives violate(s) the article(s) in this constitution, the following disciplinary actions will come into effect:

1. To avoid any conflict of interest, UMSU oversees any violations of constitutions. Every situation will be different and thus, UMSU will always have full oversight and discretion regarding what the verdict is, when the verdict takes place, and decide if disciplinary action is necessary. This is to guarantee a fair process and the well-being of students, the club, the overall campus community, and relevant stakeholders. UMSU will be responsible for explaining the violation and the possible repercussions. UMSU will also provide recommendations for how the club can move forward after the violation and consequences are settled. 
2. To maintain equity, the severity of repercussions will depend on the weight of the constitution violation and the specifics of the situation. UMSU will act as a neutral third party in assessing the infringement and will pass down an appropriate conclusion on the matter. This will be based on precedent and UMSU bylaw parameters.
3. Depending on the severity of the violation, CSSA may lose our recognition status, club funding, services, benefits, be expelled from UMSU, and/or receive repercussions from relevant stakeholders. Individual executive(s) may be dismissed from their term in office, lose benefits, lose services, expelled from the club, and/or receive personal repercussions from relevant stakeholders. Relevant stakeholders most importantly include the University of Manitoba Administration.

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of disciplinary punishments as UMSU will have full discretion regarding the matter.

### CSSA agrees and understands the content above regarding what may happen if they violate their own constitution.
